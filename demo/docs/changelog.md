## v0.8.2 - 2019-01-11
## Highlights:
Another small patch to get out some more important fixes:
- Launcher fixed for OSX
- Fixed 'stuck' workers being exclusively selected for building (oops.. RIP)
- Major map resource / expansion decomposition overhaul
- Initial support for exposing render and feature layer data 

Various other fixes:
- Freeing of squares on the placement grid when a unit is destroyed now actually works
- Associating a new townhall to its base / expansion location also now actually works
- Initial geyser, mineral field, and ramp plate cells now marked as unplaceable and/or unpathable as appropriate
- Fix expansion order and pathing on maps with islands or otherwise full blocked expos
- Fixed calculation of mineral line and behind behind line areas (still not perfect, but a ton better)

Also:
- default stepIncrement for engine systems bumped to 2
- sc2:DebugOnScreen now shows active earmarks
- Added utils/geometry/point getNeighbors()
- Added utils/map/cluster clusterByNeighbor()
- Expansion cluster now takes geyser placement into consideration

## v0.8.1 - 2019-01-08
## Highlights:
Small patch to get out some important fixes
- Fixed path separator issue (thanks MrRacoon!)
- Fixed height calculation just being wrong :)
- added `chatReceieved` event (yay!)
- fixed broken footprint checks (still need to document footprints...)
- builder systems can now build pylons if you really want them to
- added a plate types group (for unbuildable plates at the base of the main ramp)

##  v0.8.0 - 2019-01-01
###  Highlights:
- Initial support for in-engine unit footprinting and placements (footprints look like: { w: number, h: number }, for instance, a mineral field would be { w: 2, h: 1 })
- Initial support for custom maps (or at least the engine shouldn't explode if it doesn't understand map topography or player configuration)
###  Added
- Initial support for unit type systems (good luck figuring it out how it works before i write docs :p)- Added some more proto api enums to the built-ins 
- MORE DEBUG COLORS! yay debugging
- Added `unitHasDisengaged` event
- Constants
  - Added a bunch of group constants for convenience: structuresTypes, flyingStructureTypes, addonTypes, constructionAbilities
  - Added WarpUnitAbility which maps a warp unit to its training ability id.

- Unit Resource enhancements
  - Added support for ALLY type units  
  - `getGasMines(filter: UnitFilter) => Unit[]`  
  - `getConstructingWorkers() => Unit[]` (workers with active building orders)  

- Unit Entity enhancements
  - `canMove() => bool`
  - `isHolding() => bool` - hold position check
  - `canShootUp() => bool`
  - `isStructure() => bool` - this is very literal
  - `isFinished() => bool` - same as filtering u.buildProgress >= 1
  - `isCombatUnit() => bool` - also pretty literal
  - `isConstructing() => bool` - same as filtering u.buildProgress < 1
  - `is(type: UnitTypeId) => bool` - same as filtering unit.unitType === UnitType.FOO
  - `data() => UnitTypeData` - retrieves the static UnitTypeData for the unit type
  - `abilityAvailable(ability: AbilityId) => bool` - checks if an ability is available this frame synchronous
  - `availableAbilities() => Array<AbilityId>` - returns all available abilities this frame, synchronous
  - `getLabel(label) => any` - alias of u.label.get(l)
  - `removeLabel(label) => bool` - alias of u.label.delete(l)
  - `hasLabel(label) => bool` - alias of u.label.has(l)
  - `addLabel(label, component: any) => Map<string: UnitTag, any>` - alias of u.label.add(l, component)
  - `toggle => Promise<SC2APIProtocol.ResponseAction>` - toggles some unit transformation, currently works for warp prism and liberator
  - `burrow => Promise<SC2APIProtocol.ResponseAction>` - currently only works on widow mines (and don't ask how to unburrow them :p)

  - `isCustom() => bool`
  - `isPathable(point) => bool` 
  - `isPlaceable(point) => bool`

  - `getHeight() => number`
  - `getSize() => { w: number, h: number }` (the 2DI map size)  
  - `getCenter(pathable?: boolean) => Point2D` (optionally require the closest pathable point vs absolute center) 
  - `isPlaceableAt(unitType, position) => bool` (this.. surprisingly works pretty well) 
  - Added some functions for internal graph cloning and manipulation  

- Map System enhancements
  - Initial support for calculating wall-offs `onGameStart`. Currently only attempts the natural wall. Check it out with `set DEBUG=sc2:debug:*,sc2:DrawDebugWalls` and retrieve it with map.getNatural().getWall()
  - Added effect events and effect data propegation
    - `onNewEffect`
    - `onExpiredEffect`

  - `pause()`
  - `unpause()`

- Agent Entity enhancements
  - `canAffordN(unitType, maxN) => number` (return the max you can afford)  

- Builder System enhancements

  - `gridsInCircle(centerPoint, radius) => Point2D[]`, returns all map cells in a given radius

- `utils/geometry/plane` enhancements
  - `cellsInFootprint(centerPoint, footprint) => Point2D[]`, returns all Point2Ds in the footprint of a unit

- `utils/map/region` enhancements

- Fixed the way tile height is calculated to not be terrible (it's still broken, but less broken)

  - events will no longer be swallowed sometimes when still having readers  

- Constants
Changes are mainly for improving consistency and behavior
  - Added `UnitTypeId`, `AbilityId`, and `UpgradeId` to the main export (these are the reverses, to get the string representation of the ids from the ids - for stuff like labels / debugging)

  - `build` tasks now take an extra step to verify the thing they are building has started, to stop derps, before moving on 
  - will now warp in units with a normal `train` task  
  - robustified `ability` to support more scenarios (like terran addons)  

- Map Resource changes
  - Updated `map.path` to allow to inject your own graph weights  
  - Updated the silly `combatRally` function to adjust as you expand (still silly tho)

- Map System changes
  - Fixed exploding on 4 player maps (but still doesn't really support it quite right yet)
  - Updates pathing and placement grids on building changes

- Actions Resource changes
  - Updated `gather` balancing heuristics
  - Updated `build` to try to reuse a nearby builder
  - Updated `build` to actually work properly with weird targets
  - Finally refactored the geyser/mine functions that weren't documented anyway
  - Training a unit properly reduces locally available resources

- Engine Entity changes
  - Added back battlenetmap cache support as a fallback again (by map name if no local version found)

- Debug Resource changes
  - Completely smashed the debug resource and put it back together (a third time now...)
  - Supports creating of arbitrary spheres, lines, and cells, custom labels, heigh, position, etc  

- System Entitiy changes
  - Systems now default to type 'agent' if not specified  
  - Fixed `stepIncrement` not actually affecting anything, should work now  
  - Allow for 'late setup' of systems after game is running

- Broke and fixed the debug resource (that isn't documented and no one actually uses yet anyway)... it's almost actually useful now. Soon.
- Fixed builder to not accidentally build things where the nat townhall should go
- The `frontOfNatural` map utility actually does what it's supposed to now (undocumented currently)
- `actions.attack()` and `actions.attackMove()` now can accept a unit or array of units to add consistency
